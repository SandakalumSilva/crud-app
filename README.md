# Laravel Blog

A simple blog application built with Laravel and styled with Bootstrap.

## Features

*   Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for blog posts.
*   User interface styled with Bootstrap.
*   RESTful routing for posts.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

*   PHP (>= 8.2)
*   Composer
*   Node.js
*   npm (or yarn)
*   A database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://your-repository-url.git
    cd your-project-directory
    ```

2.  **Install PHP dependencies:**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3.  **Install JavaScript dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

4.  **Create your environment file:**
    Copy the example environment file and make the necessary adjustments:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

5.  **Generate application key:**
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

6.  **Configure your database:**
    Open the `.env` file and update the database connection details (DB_CONNECTION, DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD).

    For example, for SQLite, you might set:
    ```env
    DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
    DB_DATABASE=/path/to/your/database.sqlite
    ```
    If using SQLite, make sure the database file exists:
    ```bash
    touch database/database.sqlite
    ```

7.  **Run database migrations:**
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

8.  **(Optional) Seed the database:**
    If the project includes database seeders, you can populate your database with initial data:
    ```bash
    php artisan db:seed
    ```

9.  **Compile assets:**
    For development:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    For production:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

10. **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```
    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage
